Virtues and Flaw:
	Virtues: (9)
		The Gift (Special)
			(St¨ªngandr has The Gift, and is trained in the use of Viktir Runes)
		Fast Caster (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(St¨ªgandr can write rune scripts much more quickly than other 
			vitkir, and can accurately inscribe the runes in half the normal 
			time. He can also fast-cast rune spells, much the same way Hermetic 
			Magi can fast-cast spontaneous spells, though he must always leave 
			off his name and the description of the effect, as there isn't time
			to inscribe them)
		Major Rune Focus (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(Pain Runes)
			(St¨ªgandr has a magical focus for all runes and effects that cause
			pain or injury (including stripping Might from Magical Creatures),
			or prolong it. Whenever he carves these runes into bone (human or 
			animal), he may double his score in the rune used for the script)
		Affinity with Kauno (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(St¨ªgandr has a way with the Kauno rune. Increase any Study Totals
			for it by half, as well as any experience put into it during 
			character creation)
		Affinity with Othila (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(St¨ªgandr learns to use the Othila rune quite quickly. Increase any
			Study Totals for it by half, as well as any experience put into it
			during character creation)
		Affinity with Tiwaz (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(St¨ªgandr has skill with Tiwaz rune. Increase any Study Totals for
			it by half, as well as any experience put into it at character 
			creation)
		Secret Runes (Minor, Supernatural) x2 -2
			(St¨ªgandr may hide the runes that describe the effect of his rune
			scripts, or may omit the inscription entirely without suffering a 
			penalty to his Casting Total. He gains no benefit from inscribing
			them normally (though he does prefer to do so when time permits as
			he thinks it looks nicer))
		Nameless Runes (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(St¨ªgandr may cast rune spells without inscribing his name at no 
			penalty, though he receives no benefit if he does. The runes 
			still act as a magical connection to him that can be used to 
			identify him, but the rune's caster is not immediately obvious to
			those who can read the runes)
	Flaws: (10)
		Blatant Gift (Major, Hermetic) +3
			(St¨ªgandr's Gift is especially strong, and exudes out of him like 
			an aura. Animals near him are disturbed, frightened, and may even
			be enraged by his presence. He is at -6 to all interactions with
			normal people and animals. This causes him no end of annoyance and
			trouble, and probably lead to his rather jaded outlook on life)
		Weird Magic (Minor, Hermetic) +1
			(St¨ªgandr's control over magic is a little loose. He rolls on extra
			botch die when he rolls a zero on a stressed spell, apart from his
			other botch dice. Botches on this die should be strange or bizarre
			rather than dangerous, and if a Weird Magic botch occurs along with
			a regular botch, the results could be truly spectacular)
		Fury (Major, Story) +3
			(St¨ªgandr is sometimes overwhelmed by a violent temper, sending him
			into a destructive, uncontrollable rage. This most often happens 
			when someone attacks or insults his family and loved ones. Roll 9 
			or higher on a stress die (modified by appropriate Personality 
			Traits) to avoid flying into a rage when such an event occurs, with
			another roll every round to try to calm yourself should you fail 
			the first. On a botch, he tries to kill everyone around him. While
			enraged, he gets a +3 to Damage, but a -1 to all other scores and
			rolls)
		Minor Magical Deficiency (Minor, Supernatural) +1
			(St¨ªgandr has a grave deficiency with the Wunjo rune, and cannot 
			use it in any of his scripts)
		Warped Magic (Minor, Supernatural) +1
			(Whenever St¨ªgandr scribes a script, his pores leak some blood, 
			with more blood being emitted with stronger scripts. This does not
			harm him significantly, but can intimidate or frighten others)
		Weird Magic (Minor, Supernatural) +1
