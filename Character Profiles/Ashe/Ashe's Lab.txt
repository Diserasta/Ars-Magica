	Virtues and Flaws:

		Virtues:
			Greater Feature (Major Structure Virtue) 	-3	(3 pts among Longevity Rituals, Cr or Co)
			(Ashe's lab contains a large pallet and a selection of diagnostic tools, for treating
      patients.)
      Gallery (Minor Structure Virtue) -1 (+1 Sa, +1 Ae, +1 Teaching)
      (A gallery around the edge of the lab allows Ashe, or others to view what is happening
      below without interrupting it, or being a hazard.)
      Spacious (Minor Structure Virtue) -1 (+2 Sa, +1 Ae)
      (Ashe's lab is quite spacious and open, both to allow students space to walk around and
      examine things, and so she can work without worrying about knocking things over.)
      Palatial (Major Outfitting Virtue) -3 (+1 Gen Q., +3 Up, +2 Hea, +4 Ae, +2 Tch, +1 pt Spec)
      (The lab is lavishly outfitted with spices and ingredients, as well as any creature comfort
      that Ashe's patients could conceivably need.)
		Flaws:
			Inhabitants (Minor Supernatural Flaw)	+1 (-1 Sa, -1 Ae, 1pt to An)
			(A herd of cats that Ashe has adopted over the years lives inside her lab. Though they know
      to stay well enough away from the glowing magical things, they still get caught up in feet
      and tend to leave furballs lying around.)
	Description:
	(Describe what the lab is (is it held in a cart? is it a room? a tree?), how it
	got to be there (and if the character knows). Any questions can be answered via
	a quick PM or FB message. Describe how it looks. Print it out and draw the lab
	if you want. Have fun with this. It's something that should reflect your
	characters. And as always, feel free to ask me any questions.)
