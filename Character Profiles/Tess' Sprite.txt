Powers:
	Crafter of Bodies
	R:Varies, D:Varies, T:Varies
	Might Cost: Varies, Init Qik - 6, Animal or Corpus
	Creates any of a number of bodies that the sprite can animate and control,
	at a cost of 1 Might Point per magnitude of effect.
	All the bodies contain some similarity to the flame, such as red hair, or
	eyes that look like glowing coals. The final level of this effect cannot be
	greater than 30. This power is slow to activate as the Sprite must trace 
	the outline of the body it wishes to create.
	Cr(Re)An or Cr(Re)Co 25: Focus Power x2 (30 Levels, +4 Level Magnitudes),
	Slow Power, Improved Powers (+2 Level Magnitudes)
	
	Warmth of the Forge
	R:Personal, D:Diameter, T:Individual
	Might Cost: 0, Init Qik - 3, Ignem
	The Sprite can heat its created body to a temperature hot enough to melt
	lead, without causing it any undue damage. Attacks from natural weapons of
	the created body gain +5 damage, and objects touched are quickly heated to
	red heat. Touching bare skin or hide causes a Light Wound, regardless of 
	other damage caused by weapons, and contact with wood will ignite it 
	instantly.
	Cr(Re)Ig 20 (Base 10, +1 Diameter, +1 Requisite): Personal Power 
	(20 Levels, Might Cost -1), Improved Powers (Might Cost -2)
Vis: 1 pawn of Ignem, in the flames
