Appearance:
	Seere appears as a beautiful man riding upon a winged horse. He has sea 
	blue eyes, and a mop of unruly hazel hair. His body is perfectly chiseled
	as if he were worked from tan stone. He usually appears wearing simple 
	peasants' clothes.
	
Despite his simple clothing choice, Seere is an incredibly wise, and often 
helpful demon. He is good-natured and will help those who summon him, unless
the summoning interrupts him helping someone else. He speaks in a smooth, 
kindly voice, and can answer questions about hidden treasures and robberies and
bring abundance. He can also go to any place on Hell and Earth to accomplish
what is wished of him by the summoner.
Seere commands 26 legions of demons in Hell.
