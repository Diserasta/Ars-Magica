	Description:
	(Describe what the lab is (is it held in a cart? is it a room? a tree?), how it
	got to be there (and if the character knows). Any questions can be answered via
	a quick PM or FB message. Describe how it looks. Print it out and draw the lab
	if you want. Have fun with this. It's something that should reflect your
	characters. And as always, feel free to ask me any questions.)
