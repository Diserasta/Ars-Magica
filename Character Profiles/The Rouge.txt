Virtues and Flaw:
	Virtues: (10)
		Puissant Bows (Minor, General) -1
			(Treat any use of Bows as 2 higher than it actually is)
		Affinity with Bows (Minor, General) -1
			(All Study Totals for Bows are increased by half, as are Experience
			Points put in to Bows during character creation)
		Affinity with Leadership (Minor, General) -1
			(Sasha is quick to grasp strategy and tactics, and can exert her 
			will with great proficiency for someone her age.
			All Study Totals for Leadership are increased by half, as are 
			Experience Points put into Leadership during character creation)
		Warrior (Minor, General) -1
			(Sasha's skill with a bow did not go unnoticed for long, and she 
			was accepted in to the army, however it wasn't long until her quick
			grasp of battefield tactics (and constant disobedience of orders 
			she thought were 'stupid'), and excellent perception was noticed
			by a visiting general, who quickly took her on as his apprentice.
			This generally made a lot of officers in the army incredibly angry,
			as a child, no less a female child had stolen what they saw as the
			position they were fighting for. In point of fact, many find it 
			incredibly hard to believe that a female can accomplish anything,
			let alone be a skilled tactician.
			She may learn Martial Abilities at character generation, and has 50
			extra xp for them)
		Apt Student (Minor, General) -1
			(Sasha is especially good at learning from others, and adds 5 to 
			her Advancement Total any time someone else teaches her)
		Book Learner (Minor, General) -1
			(When learning from a book, treat the Quality of the book as 3 
			higher than it actually is)
		Greater Power (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(Because Sasha is so close to the Platonic ideal for a bow-hunter,
			the Magic Realm tries its best to make her 'the' ideal hunter. She 
			has a Power that can be activated at will, designed as a Hermetic
			Spell of a maximum Level of 50, and a Initiative of Qik - (Mag/2).
			The Spell costs Mag/2 Might Points, and as Sasha has no Might, 
			costs a Fatigue Level for each 5 Might Point cost, or fraction
			therof)
		Variable Power (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(As Sasha gets closer and closer to a perfect hunter, her powers
			grow stronger and stronger. She may add 5 levels to her Greater 
			Power for each point in her Bows Score, or add a similar effect of 
			equal level (For example a shapeshifting power gains a new shape))
	Flaws: (10)
		Ability Block (Minor, General) +1
			(Sasha has never had any skill with formal logic, and has no real
			desire to learn it. As such she can't learn Artes Liberales, any 
			Law, Medicine or Theology)
		Small Frame (Minor, General) +1
			(Sasha's Size is -1, and she takes Wounds in 4 point increments)
		Enemies (Major, Story) +3
			(Sasha has made herself many enemies in the army due to her quick
			ascension through the ranks, and her great skill with strategy and 
			tactics. More so, most army members think women shouldn't be in the
			army, and are butt-furious that she has even a minor spot in the 
			army, let alone apprenticed to a general. She will occassionally 
			get attacked by mobs of army-men and anyone associating with her 
			will probably end up in the Russian military's bad books. Often 
			only her wits and tactical sense get her out of these situations
			alive, and often barely so, with many injuries, or casualties)
		Essential Flaw (Major, General) +3
			(Sasha is a psychopath, through and through. She cannot feel 
			emotion as most people would describe it, and this makes her come
			across as incredibly cold. She has no problems with manipulating 
			people for personal or strategic gain, and can be ice cold in all
			but the most dire straits. This doesn't mean she doesn't have goals
			or ambitions; just that nothing is off the table when it comes to 
			achieving a particular goal. This does not mean she is cruel 
			either (cruelty would be a foreign concept to a primary 
			psychopath), simply that she would choose the most efficient or 
			effective way forward. It should also be noted that a psychopath is
			not someone who would necessarily throw away the lives of their 
			comrades; in fact, most psychopaths put extremely high priorities 
			on their comrades, and try to keep them alive. It's simply that if
			losing a comrade is the only possible way to survive, they will 
			have no scruples about doing so.
			Sasha has the Essential Flaw Psychopath at -6, and must apply it to
			any rolls involving showing or conveying emotion, or attempting to
			sway someone through emotive means (as opposed to logic, or 
			intimidation) 
			Roleplay her lack of emotion. If you're having trouble imagining a
			character who is a primary psychopath, think Nao from Aldnoah/Zero,
			or Reki from Hidan no Aria, or Yin from Darker than Black)
		Environmental Sensitivity(Minor, General) +1
			(Sasha is unnaturally intolerant to salt water, and gets a -3 
			penalty to Debilitation checks in salt water)
		Unlucky (Minor, General) +1
			(Sasha doesn't have much in the way of luck. She gets a -1 to -3 
			penalty on rolls in situations where luck is the main factor rather
			than skill or talent)

Powers:
	(50 + 5*Bows for the Power)
	A Hunter Is Never Without Her Arrows
	R:Touch, D:Sun, T:Group
	Might Cost 1, Init Qik - 6, Terram
	This spell conjures a bolt, arrow, or other type of ammunition (assuming
	Sasha knows what the ammunition looks like) made from a hardened shaft of
	steel and a tip of Sasha's choice. 
	The arrow lasts for a while to allow for travel time, as well as so it can 
	be used later if need be. The Rego requisite allows the arrow to be 
	propelled by the bow/ballista/arbalest used as if it weighed the same as a
	feather.
	The Base is the sum of the base for create base metal (Base 5 for iron),
	and create precious gemstone (+5 Magnitudes). The Group target allows for a
	greater amount of material (as well as several materials) to be generated 
	so that a bolt for a seige weapon could be created.
	Each additional magnitude can add an aditional type of arrow or material of
	arrow and/or tip.
	The arrows themselves provide Attack +2, Damage +2 due to their high speed.

Appearance:
	Sasha is a short, slim girl, who looks even younger than she is. She has
	stunning blue eyes, and pitch black hair, which falls loosely around her
	shoulders. Her features are reasonably androgynous, and with a name like
	Sasha, it's hard to tell at first glance whether she's a male or a female.
	This causes Sasha no end of trouble, as she is neither good at 
	communicating, nor does she enjoy the attention that comes with being 
	beautiful. 
	Sasha has a reasonably cold demeanour, and has a shoot-first-ask-questions-
	never sort of outlook on her jobs. She usually prefers to let the delegates
	and other officials do the bargaining, and simply for them to call on her
	if her combat skills are needed.
	When otherwise engaged in conversation, 
	she is quiet and curt, only talking when it is absolutely necessary.
