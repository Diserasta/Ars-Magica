Powers:

	
	N.B. Boundary +5 is roughly the diamater of the Earth. As such it should
	pick up all humans on Earth. Also worth noting is that his constant Gather
	the Thoughts power means that he can sense all the humans by virtue of his
	constant telepathic connection with them, however this would seem to break
	Hermetic Limits, as the spell must have begun at some point.
	
	Coagulation
	3 points, Init -1, Corpus
	Allows Dantalion to condense into his physical form. This takes 25 rounds
	(just over 1 Diameter), and may be cancelled at any time. He may also

Appearance:
	Dantalion is man with many appearances, having the countanance of every
	man and woman. He is of medium height and build, and carries a large tome
	in his right hand. He is often seen wearing the clothes of a scholar, but
	more often simply appears with the same clothes as the summoner.
	
Dantalion is a Great Duke of Hell, having command of 36 legions of demons. He 
is not particularly good-natured, but will perform what is asked of him if an
offering of equal value is given to him. He often seeks knowledge of other
realms as they interest him greatly.
He knows all arts and sciences, and can teach them to anyone. He also knows the
thoughts of every man and woman, and can tell the summoner of any secret known
by a human.
