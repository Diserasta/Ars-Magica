	Virtues and Flaws:

		Virtues:
			Greater Feature (Major Structure Virtue) -3	(+2 Ae, 3 pts among Exp, Spells,
      Cr, Re, An, Vi)
			(A giant summoning circle sits in the centre of Aelita's lab, dominating a large
      amount of the floor space. It is decorated with mystical symbols and runes. A
      circle of candles and useful specimens sit around the circle to act as a focus.
      This makes it somewhat awkward to work around and a Greater Focus for this Lab.)
      Auspicious Shape (Minor Structure Virtue) -1 (+1 Ae, +1 Vi)
      (Aelita's ice cavern is laid out as a central rounded hexagonal chamber, with small
      dedicated rooms coming off each point. This form is beneficial to channelling and
      directing magic.)
      Spacious (Minor Structure Virtue) -1 (+2 Sa, +1 Ae)
      (There is enough spare room in the cavern to allow Aelita to spread her tools and
      equipment out so that it's less precarious to work inside the Lab.)
      Ice Cavern (Free Supernatural Virtue) F (+1 Up, +1 Wa, -2 Hea(Unless immune to cold),
      +2 Ae, +2 Re or Te)
      (Aelita's Lab is actually carved into an cavern of ice.)
      Idyllic Surroundings (Free Structure Virtue) F (+2 Hea, +1 Ae, 1 pt among Cr, An,
      He or Te)
      (Aelita's mental Lab actually contains more than just the Lab itself. It also
      contains a small glade outside the cavern, which is home to many fantastical
      plants that Aelita has imagined, as well as a small stream.)
		Flaws:
      Greater Focus (Major Structure Flaw) +3 (-2 Gen Q., 4 pts among Feature Specs)
      (Aelita's summoning circle is ornamented extremely heavily, and also saps some of
      magical power of its user to power itself, making Lab Projects that don't use it
      harder to complete.)
			Mental Construct (Major Structure Flaw)	+3 (-5 Up, +2 Wa, -2 Ae, +3 Me)
			(Aelita's Lab is contained entirely in her mind. This was achieved with an
      extremely powerful Creo Mentem ritual that cost her a sizable amount of her
      life savings. The Lab's imaginary portion can only be of Size Aelita's Intelligence
      or less, and the Lab may be improved as per usual. However, disregard any changes
      to Upkeep, Health, or Aesthetics. Without incredibly sophisticated magic, Aelita
      is unable to use this Lab to bond with a familiar, enchant items or Longevity
      Rituals, or teach. She can still invent spells, work with Lab Texts and study Arts
      "normally".)
	Description:
	(Describe what the lab is (is it held in a cart? is it a room? a tree?), how it
	got to be there (and if the character knows). Any questions can be answered via
	a quick PM or FB message. Describe how it looks. Print it out and draw the lab
	if you want. Have fun with this. It's something that should reflect your
	characters. And as always, feel free to ask me any questions.)
