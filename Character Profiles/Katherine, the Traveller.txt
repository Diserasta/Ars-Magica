Virtues and Flaw:
  Virtues: (-10)
    The Gift (Special) S
    Faerie Background (Free, Supernatural) F
    The Gentle Gift (Major, Hermetic) -3
    Persona (Minor, Supernatural) -1
      (Katherine is able to take on multiple personas. These personae are
      all physically distinct, and have different personalities. It takes
      one round to change between personas, and the changes are total. To
      all mundane and magical investigation, the personas are separate
      people. This grants the Ability Persona, which begins at 1 and
      allows for an extra persona whenever it is raised. The new persona
      must be created immediately when the Ability is raised)
    Strong Faerie Blood (Major, Supernatural) -3
      (Katherine has the blood of a Faerie God, specifically a lesser
      harvest god known to the Celts. She gains 1 point worth of Sympathy
      Traits for Traits characteristic to the god whose blood she shares.
      She begins Aging at age 50 and has an intrinsic -3 to all Aging Rolls
      All her Personae look rather striking due to this. Additionally, she
      can increase her Sympathy Traits to 3 higher than the usual max)
    Faerie Legacy (Minor, Supernatural) -1
      (Katherine's Faerie Blood is particularly strong, and she gets an
      additional point of Sympathy Traits)
    Great Presence (Minor, General) -1
      (No matter which persona she takes, Katherine always draws eyes;
       whether by sheer awe-inspiring beauty or by overbearing stature)
    Frightful Presence (Minor, Supernatural) -1
      (Katherine's Personae are capable instilling great dread through her
      appearance by radiating an aura of awe and splendour that makes others
      weak at the knees.
      Everyone witnessing this display must make an immediate Brave Personality
      Roll vs an Ease Factor of 3 + |Katherine's Presence|. A failure means
      they are cowed by her glory, or immediately attempt to flee her presence
      (depending on their Personality and Katherine's intentions).
      If the targets remain within her presence (because they are awed, or
      otherwise trapped), they can reattempt the Brave Roll every two minutes.
      Once a person has been affected by the Frightful Presence and recovered
      from its effects, they cannot be affected again, although she will
      acquire an appropriate Reputation (Such as Fearsome of Awesome) at a
      score of 2 among those affected, which will colour your dealings with
      them)
  Flaws: (+10)
    Faerie Upbringing (Minor, Personality) +1
      (Katherine is an orphan who was abandoned by her parents due to her
      unnatural looks, and was taken in by a group of fae who thought her a
      incarnation of one of the harvest gods. She has an enhanced
      understanding of the fair folk and magic)
    Enemies (Major, Story) +3
      (The Church has suspicions that Katherine might be one of the Fae, and
      several people who have grudges against Lawrence have reported her to
      the Church as a pagan god. As such, there are a few chapters who are
      out to get her, and are trying to spread the news that she's a
      heretic)
    Pagan (Major, Story) +3
      (Katherine is a devout pagan, which is pretty obvious considering that
      she is essentially an incarnation of a pagan god. She avoids and
      dislikes churchmen, and cannot pass as a Christian, though she will
      stay quiet if need be)
    Faerie Antipathy (Major, Supernatural) +3
      (Katherine has a negative link associated with the Faerie Realm, and
      must apply it to any roll where it is relevant. It begins at -3, but
      can be raised or lowered as per usual)

Appearance:
  Katherine:
    Katherine is quite tall for a woman, coming in at just over 174cm. She has
    long, copper hair which reaches halfway down her back, and pale skin,
    dotted with a few freckles here and there. She has striking green eyes
    that almost seem to draw you in.
  Fritz:
    Fritz is pretty much what you'd expect when you hear the name Fritz.
    He's tall, well-built and tanned. He has short, cropped black hair,
    and brilliant blue eyes.
	Persephone:
		Persephone looks strikingly similar to Katherine, except that her hair is
		the colour of autumn leaves (as opposed to the bright copper of Katherine),
		and her eyes are leaf green. She is slightly taller than Katherine and
		holds herself with a majesty appropriate for a god. Persephone is the only
		persona aware of their powers, and she is loathe to let the others into her
		secrets, as she has been burned by it before. That was why she moved
		Katherine to be front-most persona and wiped the memory of the rest.
