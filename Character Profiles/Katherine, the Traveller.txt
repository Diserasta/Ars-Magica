			all physically distinct, and have different personalities. It takes
			one round to change between personas, and the changes are total. To
			all mundane and magical investigation, the personas are separate 
			people. This grants the Ability Persona, which begins at 1 and 
			allows for an extra persona whenever it is raised. The new persona
			must be created immediately when the Ability is raised)
