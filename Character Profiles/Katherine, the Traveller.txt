        The Gift (Special) S
        Faerie Background (Free, Supernatural) F
        The Gentle Gift (Major, Hermetic) -3
		Persona (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(Katherine is able to take on multiple personas. These personae are
			all physically distinct, and have different personalities. It takes
			one round to change between personas, and the changes are total. To
			all mundane and magical investigation, the personas are separate 
			people. This grants the Ability Persona, which begins at 1 and 
			allows for an extra persona whenever it is raised. The new persona
			must be created immediately when the Ability is raised)
		Strong Faerie Blood (Major, Supernatural) -3
            (Katherine has the blood of a Faerie God, specifically a lesser 
            harvest god known to the Celts. She gains 1 point worth of Sympathy
            Traits for Traits characteristic to the god whose blood she shares.
            She begins Aging at age 50 and has an intrinsic -3 to all Aging Rolls
            All her Personae look rather striking due to this. Additionally, she
            can increase her Sympathy Traits to 3 higher than the usual max)
        Faerie Legacy (Minor, Supernatural) -1
            (Katherine's Faerie Blood is particularly strong, and she gets an
            additional point of Sympathy Traits)
	Flaws: (+4)
		Faerie Upbringing (Minor, Personality) +1
            (Katherine is an orphan who was abandoned by her parents due to her
            unnatural looks, and was taken in by a group of fae who tought her a
            incarnation of one of the harvest gods. She has an enchanced 
            understanding of the fair folk and magic)
        Enemies (Major, Story) +3
            (The Church has suspicions that Katherine might be one of the Fae, and
            several people who have grudges against Lawrence have reported her to
            the Church as a pagan god. As such, there are a few chapters who are
            out to get her, and are trying to spread the news that she's a
            heretic)
        Pagan (Major, Story) +3
            (Katherine is a devout pagan, which is pretty obvious considering that
            she is essentially an incarnation of a pagan god. She avoids and
            dislikes churchmen, and cannot pass as a Christian, though she will
            stay quiet if need be.
