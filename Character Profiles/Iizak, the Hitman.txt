			attacks someone while they are unaware of him.
		Spring Regio Network (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			As reward for copmleting a task for a magical spirit that 
			inhabited a lake that a man had been murdered in (Iizak was to find
			the killer and bring him to her), Iizak was allowed access to a 
			network of regiones located at the bottom of lakes and springs. He 
			may move from any regio to any other regio in the network in one 
			Diameter, regardless of geographic distance.
			Iizak may attempt to figure where a networked regio is located in a
			particular area with a Intelligence + (Area) Lore roll against an

	Flaws: (5)

			Iizak's sense of taste is so weak that only highly flavoured food 
			is palatable, and as such he often piles spice onto his food.
		Weakness (Personality, Minor) +1
			Iizak has a soft spot for a pretty face and a nice voice, and this 
			has caused him no end of trouble. It has however, gotten him to 
			work with Magical creatures, that he would've otherwise never met
			or worked with due to most people's fear of them. Curiously, his
			Spring Regio Network was granted by a Huldra.
		Outlaw (Social Status, Major) +3
			Iizak has been outlawed from most of Italy for his occassional
			hired murder where he was seen, and has a reputation to match.

Powers:
	
Appearance:
Iizak is an average height guy, with incredibly pale skin, and deep blue eyes.
He was shaggy neck-length white hair, though it seems to shine slightly blue in
sunlight. He usually wears peasant's clothing, though he dows own more 
expensive clothing for when the situation calls for it.

Iizak is a rather curious and often helpful guy, and has made a bit of a 
reputation for himself as a general problem solver. Most people just assume 
that this means he's a hitman, but that's hardly the case. He's willing to do
most anything for a decent price, and has even been contracted by magical 
creatures and the fae on occassion. It's from these jobs that he acquired his
magical blood and regio network, as most magical creatures have no use for 
money and pay for his services in other ways.
