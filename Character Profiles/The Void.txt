		Strong Faerie Blood (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(Nymph Blood
			+1 Com
			Additionally, she gets -3 to all Aging Rolls, and starts aging at 
			50 instead of the usual 35. She can also see normally in darkness 
			or semi-darkness. She also has leaf patterns all over her body that
			are ever so slightly lighter than her skin colour. They are not 
			extremely noticable, but do contribute to her stunning aura. People 
			may fear her if they notice, and may react with anger or confusion)
		Great Presence (Minor, General) x2 -2
			(X is stunningly beautiful and graceful, and draws gazes even when 
			does her best to hide her appearance. She is also capable of putting
			on an awe-inspiring visage)
		Unaging (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(X does not suffer the effects of age. Her aging points do not 
			decrease her Characteristics, only building up to give her 
			Decrepitude points. If a crisis is not potentially fatal, she
			suffers no ill effects. If it is potentially fatal, she dies if
			she fails the Stamina roll, but otherwise nothing happens. She is
			not enfeebled at 4 Decrepitude points, but dies as normal at five.
			She may choose her apparent age age freely)
	Flaws: (3)
		Mute (Major, General) +3
			(X cannot speak, and has never been able to. Her vocal cords are 
			actually in perfect working order, so no one is really sure why she
			can't speak, but it is what it is)
