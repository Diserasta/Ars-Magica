Virtues and Flaw:
	Virtues: (10)
		The Gift (Special)
			(Relly has The Gift, and knows how to use it)
		Faerie Blood (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(Relly has the blood of the Sidhe in her, and receives a +1 to 
			Presence, as well as a -1 to all aging rolls. Her strange 
			appearance is probably due to this lineage)
		Gentle Gift (Major, Hermetic) -3
			(Relly's gift is gentle, and doesn't disturb others the way a 
			normal Gift would. She suffers no social penalties due to her 
			magical nature)
		Fast Caster (Minor, Supernatural) F
			(Relly can write rune scripts much more quickly than other vitkir,
			and can accurately inscribe the runes in half the normal time. She 
			can also fast-cast rune spells, much the same way Hermetic Magi can
			fast-cast spontaneous spells, though she must always leave off her
			name and the description of the effect, as there isn't time to 
			inscribe them)
		Secret Runes (Minor, Supernatural) x2 -2
			(Relly may hide the runes that describe the effect of her rune 
			scripts, or omit the description entirely, without suffering a 
			penalty to her Casting Total. She gains no benefit from inscribing
			runes normally but does receive the normal benefit for exaggerating 
			the runes)
		Nameless Runes (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(Relly may cast rune spells without inscribing her name at no 
			penalty, though she receives no benefit if she does. The runes 
			still act as a magical connection to her that can be used to 
			identify her, but the rune's caster is not immediately obvious to
			those who can read the runes)
		Mythic Alchemy (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(See Notes)
	Flaws: (10)
		Small Frame (Minor, General) -1
			(Relly is quite tiny. Her Size is -1 and she takes Wounds in 4 
			point increments)
		Dark Secret (Major, Story) -3
			(Relly is a Vikti, and might be hunted down by the Order of Hermes
			if anyone found out. Additionally, many people in the Order would
			resent her even if she did swear the Oath, and might continue to 
			hunt her even then)
		Close Family Ties (Minor, Story) -1
			(Runa's family is incredibly close, considering they're one of the 
			few rune mages left alive. Even without that, they love each other
			and would do anything for one another. They will always come to 
			each other's aid, and will often cross immense distances to do so)
		Irritable (Major, Personality) -3
			(Relly is incredibly irritable, and often gets loud and boisterous,
			shouting and cursing at those who annoy her. It doesn't take much 
			to annoy her either, so she is often shouting at people. Even so, 
			her friends, or those who she would call friends anyway, know she 
			means well, even if she does tend to be fiery)
		Warped Magic (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(Whenever Relly scribes a script, whispers are heard near the runes
			for a short while, relating to the effect of the spell. These 
			whispers are also heard when she uses her Muspelli powers)
		Weird Magic (Minor, Supernatural) -1
		Low Self-Esteem (Minor, General) S
			(Runa has sworn to give up her personal destiny to serve Urdur, so
			she has a Confidence Score of 0. Note that since this is a General
			Flaw, she loses it while in etin-mod, and as such can use 
			Confidence while in etin-mod. Thus, she is allowed to gain 
			Confidence, but starts with none)

Rune Scripts:
	See Relly's Grimoire 
Appearance:
	Relly is a rather small girl, coming in at just over 150cm and 44kg, she is
	the sort of person you could pick up and throw without too much exertion.
	Not that she'd let you, mind. She has fair skin; short, cropped, rusty red 
	hair, and bright crimson eyes. This unnatural appearance makes her stick 
	out like a sore thumb in most locales, and people are often suspicious of 
	her strange appearance despite her Gentle Gift.

						Etin-Mod
	Characteristics:
		Int: +2
		Per:  0
		Pre: +2
		Com: -2
		Str: +2
		Sta: +1
		Dex: +3
		Qik: +2
	Size: +2
	Virtues and Flaws:
		Giant Blood (Major, General)
			(Runa's Etin-Mod is Size +2, and so it takes Wounds in 7 point 
			increments. Additionally, both her Strength and Stamina are 
			increased by one when she takes on the etin-mod)
		Greater Immunity to Sleep (Major, General)
			(Runa still gets tired in etin-mod, but does not need to (and 
			indeed cannot) actually fall asleep while the form is maintained.
			She is also immune to spells that would put her to sleep, or would
			force her into unconsciousness. If she should tire herself to the
			Unconscious Fatigue Level, then she reverts to human form 
			immediately)
		Greater Magical Defenses (Minor, Supernatural)
			(Runa's Magical Defenses are double when she in etin-mod)
	Qualities:
		Tireless
			(While in etin-mod, Runa has two extra Fatigue Levels)
		Imposing Appearance
			(While in etin-mod, Runa has golden wings made from tiny golden
			threads, and her body is held by coils of interweaving golden 
			threads that terminate in the air around her. This awe-inspiring 
			appearance gives her a +1 to Presence while in etin-mod)
	Appearance:
		While in etin-mod, Runa takes the form of an extremely beautiful and 
		tall woman, with flowing crimson hair and alabaster skin. Her body also
		looks to be held by impossibly thin golden threads, as if she were a 
		marionette caught up in its own strings. These threads also loop around
		behind her and form 2m golden wireframe wings.
	Soak: +3
