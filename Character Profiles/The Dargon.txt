			some of the other covenant members accept him as a part of the 
			covenant. Most outsiders however think that a dragon inside a

			immediately, and harvested for vis.

Powers:
	
	Crafter of Ignem
	R:Varies, D:Varies, T:Varies
	Might Cost: Varies, Init 0, Ignem
	Duplicates any of a range of non-Ritual Creo or Rego Ignem spells, at a 
	cost of 1 Might Point per magnitude of the effect. The level of the effect
	cannot be greater than 25, or Mal's Might Score, whichever is lower.
	This is how most dragons get their flame-breathing powers:
	(CrIg 15, +2 Voice, doing +15 damamge in an unnatural shape (a jet))
	CrIg or ReIg 25: Focus Power
	
	Flight of the Drake
	R:Touch, D:Sun, T:Individual
	Might Cost: 0, Init 0, Aurum
	Mal can fly through the air at up to 40 miles per hour, by creating a 
	great gust of wind in front of his wings. As such, he does need to flap his
	wings to maintain flight, but can glide almost silently without losing too
	much altitude. The winds die down at Mal's command, however, they never 
	quite go away, and a cool breeze can be felt near him at nearly all times.
	The Rego requisite allows Mal to control the gusts to deflect arrows or 
	allow him to pull off unnatural manoeuvres.
	CrAu(Re) 35 (Base 5, +1 Touch, +2 Sun, +2 highly unnatural,
	+1 Rego requisite): Greater Power (35 Levels, Might Cost -3, +2 Init)
	
	Guide
	R:Voice, D:Concentration, T:Group
	Might Cost: 2, Init 0, Mentem
	Subtly influences a group of beings towards a specific course of action. 
	This is given in the same way that advice from the Common Sense virtue is,
	however, it is not neccessarily common sense, it is simply the wishes of
	the caster. There is no compulsion to follow this advice however.
	ReMe 30 (Base 5, +2 Voice, +1 Conc, +2 Group): Greater Power (30 Levels, 
	+4 Init)
	
	Scales of the Drake
	R:Personal, D:Sun, T:Part
	Might Cost: 1, Init -1
	Hardens Mal's scales to an almost steel-like hardness, granting him a +3 to
	Soak. This power is often used when he feels threatened, due to it's high 
	Duration and low cost.
	MuAn 30 (Base 15, +2 Sun, +1 Part): Personal Power x2 (30 levels, 
	Might Cost -2, +2 Init)
Vis: 5 pawns of Ignem vis, in his tongue.
	
Appearance:
	Mal is rather large for his age, coming in at larger than even most adult
	drakes. He has deep blue scales with a slight pearlescent sheen to them,
	as well as silver eyes. Despite this wizened look, he is still rather young,
	if extremely intelligent. This does cause him to be overly cocky on 
	occassion, which has lead to some rather nasty scars.
