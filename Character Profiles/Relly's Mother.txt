Virtues and Flaws:
	Virtues: (10)
		Strong Faerie Blood (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(Rignhildr is the daughter of a court faerie who was visiting the
			Scandinavian lands. She has the blood of the Sidhe within her, and
			as such gets +1 Presence, and is at -3 for all aging rolls, and 
			only starts aging at 50, instead of 35. She can also see normally 
			in darkness or semi-darkness.)
		Gentle Gift (Major, Hermetic) -3
			(Rignhildr has the Gentle Gift, as such her Gift does not disturb 
			others)
		Good Teacher (Minor, General) -1
			(Rignhildr is good at explaining concepts and skills. Add three to
			the Quality of any books she writes, and five to the Advancement 
			Total of anyone who studies with her)
		Unaffected by the Gift (Minor, Supernatural) -1
			(Rignhildr is strangely unaffected by the Gift. Even people with 
			the Blatant Gift aren't particularly bothersome to her, though she
			can tell they are different. This may explain her choice in 
			husband)
		Great Communication (Minor, General) x2 -2
			(Rignhildr has a gift with words and can appease nearly anyone)
		Puissant Rune Magic (Minor, Supernatural) F
			(Treat any use of Rune Magic as 2 higher than it is)
	Flaws: (10)
		Compassionate (Major, Personality) -3
			(Rignhildr is an incredibly compassionate and kind soul, and cannot
			stand to see people suffer. She does everything in her power to 
			help those in need, and can often be a tad too kind. She does 
			however understand that at times, violence is necessary, and 
			killing other might be needed, though she is loathe to do it, and 
			would prefer persuading the attackers to never do so again, or at 
			the very worst, maiming them)
		Restriction (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(Rignhildr cannot cast spells at all on targets made from glass, or
			carve runes on glass)
		Natt-thel Prone (Major, Supernatural) -3
			(Rignhildr is particularly prone to being overwhelmed by the power
			of her magic, and suffers the effects of Natt-thel on a single 
			magical botch, instead of on a double botch)
		Close Family Ties (Minor, Story) -1
			(Runa's family is incredibly close, considering they're one of the 
			few rune mages left alive. Even without that, they love each other
			and would do anything for one another. They will always come to 
			each other's aid, and will often cross immense distances to do so)

Appearance:
	Rignhildr is rather a large woman by most standards, at 175cm and 84kg. She
	is what you would expect from a stereotypical Viking: the men are big, tall
	and have beards, and the women are bigger, taller and also have beards. Not
	that she has a beard mind, but she does fit the image quite well. She has 
	large orange discs for eyes and dirty blonde hair.
